# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Using supervised machine learning to determine credit risk.

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of the analysis is to evaluate the performance of several machine learning models to determine if they should be used to predict credit risk.

## Results
The subsequent sections below will examine the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models.

### Naive Random Oversampling
